The code in here written in Arduino IDE for ESP32C6, which helps modulate the biphasic signal needed for correct stimulation of neurons with set parameters. The signal strength is formed with LM334 and is sent through 6 separate channels with the help of ADG2128. The schematics of the device were put in images. The device was tested and is in a working condition.
